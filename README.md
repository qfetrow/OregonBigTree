# OregonBigTree
A swift iOS app that interacts with Oregon Legislature API to display information about Measures and Legislators 


# Purpose

The goal of both the app and the webpage is to connect Oregonians to their local legislators and allow citizens 
to make sense of Oregon's legislative systems.  I want to make it easy for people to track state legislature and 
get their voices heard by their representatives.

# Current Functionalities

## 1.  Get representative information from address

OregonBigTree connects to the Google Civic Data API to return your state senator and representative, and their contact information,
including their phone number and e-mail.

## 2. Get information about measures that are about to be voted on.

OregonBigTree connects to the public Oregon Legislature API to display measures that will be voted on in the next few weeks. Each measure can be expanded
to show a measure summary, fiscal and revenue impacts, a timeline of all previous actions on the measure, and a link to the actual measure document.

## 3. Email Representatives

OregonBigTree provides a simple and intuitive interface to email state representatives.  Once a user discovers a measure they are passionate about,
they can press the "email senator/representative" buttons to bring up a form where they can easily type their reasoning for opposing/supporting
the bill.  Once they press "Submit Email", their device will pull up an preformatted message to be sent to their represenatative.  All the user has to do is press send.
